# Post-MVP Items

Issues, improvements, and tech debt to revisit after MVP completion.

## UX

- **Revisit clear\* commands** — Evaluate whether to route the clear memory/documents/everything confirmation and completion messages through our template message system (fill template → detect language → translate) so responses are auto-translated to the user's language. Enhance the overall flow (e.g. cancellation feedback, better confirmation prompts).
