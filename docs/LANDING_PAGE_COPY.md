## Conversion Strategy & SEO

### Primary Conversion Goal
Every element on the page drives toward one action: **tap the WhatsApp CTA**. Minimize distractions. The visitor should feel "this is easy, this is safe, let me try it."

### Strength Ranking (by conversion impact)
1. **Zero Friction** — #1 seller. "No app, no signup" removes the biggest barrier. Lead with this everywhere.
2. **Privacy First** — High trust signal, especially for Gulf/MENA audience. People are cautious about AI + personal data.
3. **The Smartest AI** — The use case showcase (analysis, writing, images) shows *value*. This is what makes people curious enough to try.
4. **Learns & Remembers You** — Differentiator from ChatGPT. Becomes compelling after they understand the basics.
5. **Open Source** — Trust signal for tech-savvy users. Less impact on general audience but great for credibility and press.

### Separate Marketing Pages (SEO)
Create dedicated pages for each strength. These serve as SEO landing pages and can be linked from ads, social, and blog posts.

- `/features/no-installation` — Zero friction story. Compare with app-based assistants.
- `/features/privacy` — Deep dive on data handling, user control, deletion policy. Trust-building.
- `/features/smart-ai` — Use case showcase with examples. Analysis, planning, writing, image generation.
- `/features/personal-memory` — How Ghali learns and remembers. What makes it different from generic chatbots.
- `/features/open-source` — GitHub link, transparency philosophy, community.

Each page should have its own WhatsApp CTA and be independently useful for someone landing from search.
