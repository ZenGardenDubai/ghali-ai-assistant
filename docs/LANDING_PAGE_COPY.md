## Key Strengths

### 1. Just Message. That's It.
No app. No account. No password. Open WhatsApp, say hi, done.

### 2. Gets Smarter the More You Use It
Ghali remembers your preferences, your context, your style. It's not starting from scratch every time.

### 3. Your Stuff Stays Yours
We don't sell your data. You can see everything Ghali knows about you, and delete it anytime.

### 4. One Assistant, Everything You Need
Ask a question. Analyze a document. Write an email. Create an image. Ghali handles it all — and picks the best approach automatically.

**Visual showcase — highlight these use cases prominently:**

🔍 **Analyze anything** — Send a report, get insights. Ask complex questions, get researched answers.

📋 **Plan & strategize** — Build plans, break down goals, structure your thinking.

✍️ **Write brilliantly** — Emails, proposals, stories, social posts — in any tone, any language.

🎨 **Create images** — Describe what you want, get a stunning image in seconds. Logos, art, visuals — all from a text message.

> *Design note: These 4 use cases should be visually prominent — cards, icons, or mockup screenshots showing real WhatsApp conversations for each. Image generation especially is a wow moment. No tech jargon — show, don't tell.*

### 5. Built in the Open
Our code is public. You don't have to take our word for it.

## Conversion Strategy & SEO

### Primary Conversion Goal
Every element on the page drives toward one action: **tap the WhatsApp CTA**. Minimize distractions. The visitor should feel "this is easy, this is safe, let me try it."

### Strength Ranking (by conversion impact)
1. **Just Message. That's It.** — #1 seller. "No app, no signup" removes the biggest barrier. Lead with this everywhere.
2. **Your Stuff Stays Yours** — High trust signal, especially for Gulf/MENA audience. People are cautious about AI + personal data.
3. **One Assistant, Everything You Need** — The use case showcase (analysis, writing, images) shows *value*. Makes people curious enough to try.
4. **Gets Smarter the More You Use It** — Differentiator from ChatGPT. Compelling after they understand the basics.
5. **Built in the Open** — Trust signal for tech-savvy users. Less impact on general audience but great for credibility and press.

### Separate Marketing Pages (SEO)
Create dedicated pages for each strength. These serve as SEO landing pages and can be linked from ads, social, and blog posts.

- `/features/no-installation` — Zero friction story. Compare with app-based assistants.
- `/features/privacy` — Deep dive on data handling, user control, deletion policy. Trust-building.
- `/features/smart-ai` — Use case showcase with examples. Analysis, planning, writing, image generation.
- `/features/personal-memory` — How Ghali learns and remembers. What makes it different from generic chatbots.
- `/features/open-source` — GitHub link, transparency philosophy, community.

Each page should have its own WhatsApp CTA and be independently useful for someone landing from search.
